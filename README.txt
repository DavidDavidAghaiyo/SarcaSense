README for Operating SarcaSense

Developing a sarcasm detector model aims to provide more precise and sophisticated natural language processing, especially for conversational AI and sentiment analysis. Sarcasm is a prevalent type of metaphorical language that, frequently intended to be humorous or critical, expresses the reverse of the literal meaning. However, because sarcasm detection necessitates a grasp of language beyond the literal text, computer methods face substantial hurdles in this regard.
The key motivation behind this project is to develop a model that can reliably identify sarcastic statements which is crucial for applications such as 

Sentiment Analyis: If sarcasm is not adequately identified, it can greatly distort the sentiment portrayed in a text and produce unreliable findings. System performance for sentiment analysis can be enhanced with the use of a sarcasm detector.

Conversational AI: As chatbots and speech agents get more sophisticated, they must be able to recognise and react to sarcastic language in order to have interactions that are genuinely engaging and authentic.

Social Media Monitoring: Sarcasm is frequently used on social media sites like Twitter, and being able to recognise it can be helpful for applications like social trend analysis, customer support, and brand monitoring.

SarcaSense is a website that allows users to enter in a sentence and have it determine accurately whether or not the inputed sentence is sarcastic or not. I built my sarcasm detector model using a supervised learning approach. It is a common and well-established technique for tackling text classification problems like sarcasm detection.
A labelled dataset, such as tweets, reviews, or conversational snippets, is used to train the model in a supervised learning setup. Each label in the dataset indicates whether the input text is sarcastic or not. After that, the model gains the ability to recognise the characteristics and patterns in the input data that are connected to either sarcastic or non-sarcastic language.
Some advantages of employing a supervised learning approach include;
Interpretability; Models with supervision, such decision trees or logistic regression, can shed light on key characteristics and the decision-making process, which facilitates understanding and may even lead to model improvement.

Flexibility: To determine the best method for sarcasm detection, you can test out different feature engineering approaches and model architectures through supervised learning.

Scalability: As the labeled dataset grows, the supervised model can continue to learn and improve its performance, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Evaluation and iteration: The supervised learning framework enables you to systematically evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and iteratively refine the model based on the results.

I also decided to use Gradio to build the web Interface for SarcaSense. Gradio is a flexible Python library that, with its simplicity and flexibility, is revolutionising the deployment of machine learning models. I came across it after extensive research and experimenting.Its capacity to create machine learning model user interfaces automatically fits in nicely with my objective of creating a user-friendly sarcasm detection website. One important consideration in my decision-making process was Gradio's emphasis on experimentation and quick prototyping. 

Steps in Installing and Operating SarcaSense
Open the code in zipped folder
Go to the file named 'Home.py'. This is where the Gradio application is (If you do not have gradio installed, open a new terminal and run 'pip install gradio')
In the terminal, run the command 'gradio.app.py' or if you're using VS code, click on the run button at the top right of the screen.
The website will be launched 
Enter a sentence into the text box and click on the submit button
